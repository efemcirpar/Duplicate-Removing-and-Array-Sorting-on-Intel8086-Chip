# Duplicate-Removing-and-Array-Sorting-on-Intel8086-Chip

This assembly code is intended to replace duplicate elements in the given array with 0s. Afterwards, it shifts the 0s to the end of the array without disrupting the order of the remaining numbers. The implementation is based on the Instruction Set for Intel 8086 Architecture and can be tested using the emu8086 software.
